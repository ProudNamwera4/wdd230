        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The Marondera Chamber of Commerce is a local organization which provides educational oppotunities
            for small businesses while assisting them with their marketing. We aim to promote small businesses
            by hosting networking events by increasing their exposure and connection with other businesses.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The site targets any local small business owners who wish to expand their exposure. The organization
            does not targets any specific business interests. If you own a small business in Marondera, and wish
            to network with other business owners, this site is for you. 
        </p>
        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <p>
            • What events will the chamber be holding this month that promote business-to-business networking?
            • Where can I find contact information for the chamber's board of directors?
            • What has been the population growth in the area?
        </p>
