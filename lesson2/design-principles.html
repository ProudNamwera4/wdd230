            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>

                Hick's law is a psychological principle which states that the more options are available to 
                a person, the longer it will take for him or her to make a decision about which option is 
                best. Hick's law is also sometimes referred to as the Hick-Hyman law.
                In this example, it easier for the user to chose just between two color options. Had there
                been many options, the decision would require more thought and may result in
                detering some users from using the website.

                Every element on the page should have a visual connection with another element. They 
                should not be randomly placed because visual disconnection is the biggest cause of 
                unpleasant looking documents. We can see that in this image, the designer used a grid
                to perfectly place images. Also Justify has been used to change the space between words
                to align the text to all four edges of the text box.

                Space is one of the most important elements of design. It covers everything from the 
                small spaces between text to the big empty areas on a webpage. The effective use of 
                space can greatly contribute to an attractive, harmonious, and successful design. 
                Using white space can help you balance elements and layout your designs effectively.
                In the example, white space is used to bring the user's attention to the image.
